## Chapter 1 - Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

- Data-intensive app (DIA) vs compute-intensive app:
	- Compute-intensive: CPU power = bottleneck
	- Data-intensive: data influx = bottleneck -> amount of data (volume), complexity of data (variety), speed at which it comes into system and changes (velocity)
- Building blocks of a DIA:
	- database(s)
	- cache(s)
	- search indexes
	- stream processing
	- batch processing
- The problem with the above building blocks:
	-
