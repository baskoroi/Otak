- Information warfare
- Exploit: a piece of software that takes advantage of a software design / network vulnerability and then causes unintended/unanticipated error or misbehavior in the system.
	- e.g. Spectre, Meltdown
- IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
- Threat intelligence
- Threat contextualization
- Threat correlation
- Threat attribution: identifying and attributing an attack to an actor, and their goals, motives and sponsors.
- Vulnerability assessment
	- And what is the difference with threat assessment?!
- NIST Risk Management Framework
- Legal compliance for IH:
	- GDPR
- IRT = incident response team
- IH&R = incident handling & response
- Backup strategy for secure systems
- Data destruction standards

## Made-up vocabs lol
- IAPR: identify, analyze, prioritize, and resolve
